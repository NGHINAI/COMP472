empty slots between ambulance and exit
h(n) = number of columns - 2

can make this faster if i know where the head/closet end of ambulance to exit is so i can use that instead of 0 in the range
it looks to see how many empty space there are between the ambulance and exit

headOfAmbulance = 0
ambulanceToExit = array.shape[1]-2

for i in range(0,array.shape[1]):
	if(array[2][i],[i]=='A'):
		headOfAmbulance=+1
	else:
		continue
	if (headOfAmbulance==2 and array[2][i]=='.')):
		ambulanceToExit=-1

blocking algorithm

headOfAmbulance = 0
blockingCars = array.shape[1]-2 # a car cannot be parallel and in the same row 

for i in range(0,array.shape[1]):
	if(array[2][i],[i]=='A'):
		headOfAmbulance+=1
	else:
		continue
	if (headOfAmbulance==2 and array[2][i] in carsingame)):
		ambulanceToExit+=1
